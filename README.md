## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

As far as I can remember, this was my first ever try doing something with the grid layout, so I learned a lot about that, but I still need to train a lot.

Also, combining grid and flexbox can be very powerful.


### Continued development

I'll keep trying to learn responsive webdesign with the grid layout.
